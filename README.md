# SemEval-2018-Affect-in-Tweets
SemEval (Semantic Evaluation) is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems tackling recent NLP challenges. This year, we are participating in its first task: **[Affect in Tweets](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751)**. Given a tweet and its emotion (ex. joy, anger, sadness, or fear), our main goal is to detect the intensity of the given emotion. the intensity varies between 0 and 1 with 1 referring to maximum intensity.
